<h1 id="start"> Getting Started  üéâ </h1>

Webb Orbit is a set of Isolated EVM Testnets used for our internal testing and development. Internally it runs
a geth instance with a few tweaks to make it more suitable for our needs.

As of now, we have these testnets running:

| Testnet   | Chain Id   | Currency symbol | RPC                                  | Explorer                              |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `Athena`  | 3884533461 | ETH             | `https://athena-testnet.webb.tools`  | `https://athena-explorer.webb.tools`  |
| `Hermes`  | 3884533462 | ETH             | `https://hermes-testnet.webb.tools`  | `https://hermes-explorer.webb.tools`  |
| `Demeter` | 3884533463 | ETH             | `https://demeter-testnet.webb.tools` | `https://demeter-explorer.webb.tools` |

Need help adding these networks to your wallet like MetaMask? [Read Here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC#h_01G63GGJ83DGDRCS2ZWXM37CV5)

## Prerequisites

- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

## Installation üíª

<h1 id="usage"> Usage </h1>

<h2 style="border-bottom:none"> Quick Start ‚ö° </h2>

After installing the prerequisites, you can run the following command to start the testnet:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fetch the zk fixtures
./scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh
```

Open the `.env` file in your editor and change what it is needed, usually they are the first section of the file.

Once done you can run the following command:

```bash
source .env # This will load the environment variables
./scripts/setup-orbit.sh # This will setup the orbit chains for you
```
Next, simply run the following command to start the chains:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can now access the deployed chains, locally under `http://localhost:${PORT}` where `$PORT` depends on the chain, for example
Athena chain is running under `$ATHENA_CHAIN_PORT` port, revisit your `.env` file to get your configured ports.

## Deploy Block Explorers

To deploy the Block Explorers locally too, or on the server, you need to include the `explorers.yml` file, run the following:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f explorers.yml up -d
```

This will deploy the block explorer for each chain, which you can access on localhost `http://localhost:${PORT}`where the `$PORT` here depends on which
chain's explorer you are trying to visit, for example Athena chain explorer running under `http://localhost:${ATHENA_CHAIN_EXPLORER_PORT}`.

## Deploying the smart contracts

To deploy the smart contracts, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd deploy && yarn
```

As a quick overview of all options you can run the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy --help
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
Options:
Options:
  --help                      Show help                                [boolean]
  --version                   Show version number                      [boolean]
  --wethAddress               The address of the WETH contract          [string]
  --deployWeth                Whether to deploy WETH   [boolean] [default: true]
  --webbTokenName             The name of the webb token
                                        [string] [default: "Webb Wrapped Ether"]
  --webbTokenSymbol           The symbol of the webb token
                                                  [string] [default: "webbWETH"]
  --allowWrappingNativeToken  Whether to allow wrapping native tokens into webb
                              tokens                   [boolean] [default: true]
  --governor                  The Signature Bridge governor. Could be ETH addres
                              s, Uncompressed or Compressed Public Key  [string]
  --governorNonce             The nonce of the governor    [number] [default: 0]
  --deployMulticall3          Whether to deploy Multicall3 contract
                                                       [boolean] [default: true]
  --includeTangleEVM          Include tangle EVM chain[boolean] [default: false]
```

And here is an example of deploying a local bridge named webbWETH Bridge.

```bash
yarn deploy --deployWeth --allowWrappingNativeToken=false --webbTokenName webbWETH --webbTokenSymbol webbWETH
```

This will deploy the smart contracts to the testnets.

### Transfer the Ownership of Existing Signature Bridge

There is a sub-command for transferring the ownership of the Bridge after the deployment.

```bash
yarn deploy transfer-ownership --contractAddress <CONTRACT> --governor <ADDRESS> --governorNonce 0
```

### Deploying on Tangle Network

If you want to utilize the Tangle Network and the DKG as a governor for the deployed bridge, you will need to configure the following:

- Whitelists ChainIds
- Set Resource Ids

These steps could be done manually or using the following command:

```bash
yarn tangle --help
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
Options:
  --help                 Show help                                     [boolean]
  --version              Show version number                           [boolean]
  --wsEndpoint           The endpoint of the node
                                       [string] [default: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944"]
  --resourceIds          The resource ids                  [array] [default: []]
```

And here is an example of how you can use it:

```bash
yarn tangle --resourceIds 0x00000000000064ba293e654992a94f304b00e3ceb8fd0f7aa77301000000138a --resourceIds 0x00000000000064ba293e654992a94f304b00e3ceb8fd0f7aa773010000001389 --resourceIds 0x00000000000064ba293e654992a94f304b00e3ceb8fd0f7aa77301000000138b
```

This command will automatically do the above steps for you.

<h3 id="deploy"> Deploy with <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> ‚òÑÔ∏è</h3>

You can also deploy the testnets to a remote server using Docker. To do so, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Running with a Local Relayer

The Deployment script also generates `orbit.toml` file that could be used with the [webb relayer](https://github.com/webb-tools/relayer)
if you have it locally, you can also use it to connect to the running chains by running the following command:

```bash
webb-relayer -vvv --tmp -c ./config
```

### Running Webb Faucet

To run Webb faucet backend locally, you need first to edit `config/Rocket.toml` file's twitter section and then run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f faucet.yml up -d
```

### Cleanup

To clean up everything and start over, you can executed the following commands:

```bash
docker compose down -v

sudo rm -rf {logs,data}
```

### Deploying Smart Contracts

For the already deployed smart contracts on the testnets, refer to the [DEPLOYMENTS.md](./DEPLOYMENTS.md) file.

otherwise, the process of deploying smart contracts on the deployed chains is the same as locally.
